Shinnosuke Nohara (野原しんのすけ), also known as Shin-chan or just Shin, is the titular main protagonist of Crayon Shin-chan. He is the son of Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is "Shin-chan" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series.<br>
He is 5 years old and yet acts overtly mature. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).<br>
He is often involved in a running gag of pulling down his pants to reveal his buttocks and dance in the process with an accompanying original song. His affectionate name by relatives is Shin-chan. He is five years old and loves chocolate biscuits of the brand "Chocobi" and a TV superheronamed "Action Mask", but he dislikes green peppers. He always take care of his sister, Himawari. He inherited more genes from his mother than his father. He is lethargic, loves to eat and sleep, stingy, stubborn (a trait that passed down from his maternal grandfather to his two aunts and mother and his mother passed down to him), imagining things, cannot resist good things, opinionated and brazen which is just like his mother while the only thing same with his father is likes to watch and flirt pretty young ladies. Both Shin-chan and his sister's appearance look more like their mother. He always takes care of his sister, Himawari. Sometimes he changes the actual words, making it very funny. For example, promise becomes promotion etc. He often exhibits deep affection for his best friend, Kazama. Some of his strange activities include dressing up (often as an animal). He also causes trouble for others and then criticizes their efforts in covering for him. In general, he is outspoken and very curious. He has little to no shame.<br>

In several occasions, both in manga and anime, he is either seen doing drag or wearing animal costumes. There have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness. For example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, becoming wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes. In another episode, he gives Masao the change in cash money he has even though he knows that his mother will scold him later. However, these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. A running gag in the series involves Shin-chan being late for the bus to his school, usually due to taking a long time in the bathroom, leading Misae to begrudgingly having to take him to school on her bike. Although he always tease his mother, he is very close to his mother. There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others, and in a few rare instances he shows that deep down he really does care for his family, although he usually behaves badly with them. He is also the leader of the Kasukabe Defence Force.<br>

<h4><b>MITSI NOHARA</h4><br>

Misae Nohara (née Koyama) (野原みさえ), Mitsy Nohara in the Vitello, Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is the mother of the Nohara family, and its caretaker. She is 29 years old but she always tells people that she is 24 or 25. She is the classical housewife of post-war Japan - she cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers, and lazes all to varying degrees of success. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children (mainly Shinnosuke), she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight and has even been known to display double standards while in their company. Her famous and symbolic moves includes "drilling" others' head with her fists (known in Japanese as the "Guri-Guri Attack" (グリグリ攻撃 Guri-Guri Kōgeki)) and one or more punches to the head (sometimes shown through a "Genkotsu Scene" (げんこつシーン Genkotsu Shīn), a scene where animated "Genkotsu" (げんこつ) text covers the screen as Misae commits the act), creating comically large lumps. The punches are mainly thrown by Misae, but other characters have been known to use it as well, like Hiroshi and Nene.<br>

While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself. She always changes her hair style, as seen it is sometimes curly and sometimes long and shattered hair.<br>

She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week. For example, she is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money. However, she buys in extreme quantities, which defeats the purpose.
Her birthplace is Aso (in Kumamoto) and her sisters are Masae Koyama and Musae Koyama. Her name in the Funimation dub is Mitzi Nohara and her name in the Hindi dub is Mitsi Nohara.<br>

She takes care of her household; tends to her husband and child when they're sick; rides Shin-chan to school when he misses the bus (which is most of the time); takes an umbrella out to her husband when it's raining; cleans, shops, and otherwise works like a dog. In the morning she struggles to get Shin-chan in time for the school bus, so usually she ends up riding him on a bicycle. This motivated her to learn to drive, but she tends to scratch the car when she parks it and have small accidents, although this is usually because her child distracts her on purpose. Misae tends to bring Shin-chan just about everywhere, probably because leaving him home alone usually results in some sort of household catastrophe. However, excursions with mom just mean ample opportunities to be embarrassed (and Shin-chan usually requests compensation in the form of action figures or Chocobi snacks). Occasionally, she tries playing pretend or acting in a fun-kid sort of way to get Shin-chan to be a bit more enthusiastic - for example, when the Noharas went fishing, Misae started talking excitedly (for Shin-chan's benefit) about the possibility of catching mermaids and being led to their secret castles. "Geez, mom," Shin-chan replied with a snort, "act your age".<br>

Most of her luxury purchases, however, often end up broken, misused or otherwise ruined by her children, sometimes even before she had a chance to try them. Additionally she secretly hoards money for her own personal use. She is also known to be a terrible driver. Misae also constantly checks Shin-chan's and Hiroshi's behavior around young women and punishes them accordingly (and always seems to be in the right place at the right time when it comes to the latter). She loves telephoning, shopping and going out doors with her friend Keiko Honda.

<h6><b>Hiroshi Nohara</h6><br>
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/crayonshinchan/images/8/82/P.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130930101439">
Hiroshi Nohara (野原ひろし) (35 years old), Harry Nohara in the Vitello, Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is the father of the Nohara family, and its sole source of income as he works at as kakarichô (a low-level manager) at Futaba Shoji where he does overtime to earn a little more money and because of the 32-year mortgage he still has to pay. Quite surprisingly he still manages to have time to spend with his family. Hiroshi met Misae Koyama when he was 29 and married her soon after. Soon, they had Shinnosuke.

He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family breadwinner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. He is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take-home pay to his wife every month. He is a quiet, reasonable person who is almost always invited by his boss or a worker to drink beers - where he almost always gets drunk.

He used to smoke a lot, when Misae was pregnant by Himawari, he quit smoking as a favor for her. He was born in Omagari, Akita (a village in Daisen, Akita), and has an older brother and niece.

In the year 2020 Hiro was featured in a real-life coffee commercial for the brand Craft Boss.

Relationships
Shin-chan

Hiroshi and his son both like to watch and flirt with pretty young ladies which ends up getting punished by his wife.

Misae

He always bickers with his wife over little things but he still loves his wife, no matter what.

Shin-chan probably has inherited a habit from Hiroshi, who ogles pretty young things just as often as his son (and is chastised by Misae just as often, too). However, he is faithful to his wife, but only when awake: his dreams often deal with an office romance (and are usually rudely interrupted by Shin-chan's antics).

Where Misae is the stern disciplinarian, Hiroshi barely lays a hand on his son to reprimand him, but rather attempts to defuse Misae's temper with a few "maa, maa"s ("Now, now...") now and again. When Misae asks him to properly scold Shin-chan, Hiroshi tends to just sit down with the boy and tell him (tiredly) to shape up. He's also able to convince Shin-chan to go places he would normally not want to go by telling him about the beautiful women who are bound to be there, although this tends to incur his wife's wrath.

His weak point, besides from being roasted by his son, is his smelly socks, which are often used to wake up, threaten, and/or punish any member of the family, including the dog.

He calls Misae by her first name. Hiroshi generally sets a good example for Shin-chan, rarely coming home drunk and hardly ever using violence. Since Hiroshi rarely comes home late, the Noharas can usually eat dinner together, whether at home or at a restaurant. Even dining at fancier restaurants is a family affair. Misae and Hiroshi do have their arguments, but they always, always kiss and make up. When Hiroshi was asked to take a month-long business trip to Osaka, he wept at the thought of leaving his wife and son.

Mr. and mrs. Nohara have never gone anywhere without their son. When Misae won a trip to Guam, the entire Nohara family went; they go to zoos, spas, art museums and baseball games as a family. Perhaps this is becoming more common in Japan nowadays, but certainly the stereotypical image is of the dad too busy with work or too tired of it to do anything with the family when he is home due to extended overtime and group-building company activities. Then again, the story wouldn't be as fun if the main rabble-rousing character weren't in it.
